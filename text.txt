It was one of those days when it's a minute away from snowing and there's this
electricity in the air, you can almost hear it. And this bag was, like, dancing
with me. Like a little kid begging me to play with it. For fifteen minutes.
And that's the day I knew there was this entire life behind things, and this
incredibly benevolent force. 
If you don't get what you want, you suffer; if you get what you don't want, 
you suffer; even when you get exactly what you want, you still suffer because
you can't hold on to it forever. Your mind is your predicament. It wants to be
free of change, free of pain, free of the obligations of life and death. But
change is a law, and no amount of pretending will alter that reality.
Consider this: Is the pious being loved by the gods because it is pious, or is
it pious because it is being loved by the Gods? We speak of something carried
and something carrying, of something led and something leading, of something
seen and something seeing, and you understand that these things are all
different from one another and how they differ? So there is also something
loved and - a different thing - something loving.
